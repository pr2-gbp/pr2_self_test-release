# be excluded from the distro.  This is not the place to put things that
# should be ignored everywhere, like "build" directories; that happens in
# rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake.  Here should be listed packages that aren't
# ready for inclusion in a distro.

# This list is combined with the list in rosbuild/rosbuild.cmake.  Note
# that CMake 2.6 may be required to ensure that the two lists are combined
# properly.  CMake 2.4 seems to have unpredictable scoping rules for such
